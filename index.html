    Module 1: Phishing and Online Scams</p>
    Objective: To educate students on phishing, online scams, and how to recognize fraudulent communications.
    
    Content:
    What is phishing?
    Phishing is a serious and pervasive cyber threat that involves the fraudulent solicitation of sensitive information from unsuspecting individuals.
    Perpetrators employ deceptive tactics, including spoofed emails, text messages, and social engineering, to masquerade as legitimate entities, such 
    as financial institutions or online service providers. These malicious communications often exploit psychological vulnerabilities, creating a false
    sense of urgency or alarm, which prompts victims to divulge confidential data or click on compromised links. To mitigate the risks associated with
    phishing, it is imperative to implement robust security measures, including multi-factor authentication, regular software updates, and employee 
    education programs. Furthermore, individuals must remain vigilant, scrutinizing emails and messages for suspicious content, and reporting potential
    threats to the relevant authorities.
    
    Types of phishing attacks (email, SMS, fake websites).
   
    Email Phishing
    1. Deceptive Phishing: Fake emails that appear to come from legitimate sources.
    2. Spear Phishing: Targeted attacks on specific individuals or organizations.
    3. Whaling: Targeted attacks on high-level executives or decision-makers.
    4. Mass Phishing: Large-scale email campaigns sent to random recipients.
    
    SMS Phishing (Smishing)
    1. Text Message Phishing: Scammers send fake texts asking for sensitive info.
    2. SMS Spoofing: Scammers disguise their number as a trusted source.
   
    Fake Websites
    1. Phishing Websites: Fake sites that mimic legitimate ones to steal login credentials.
    2. Drive-by Downloads: Malware-infected sites that download viruses onto devices.
    3. URL Spoofing: Scammers disguise malicious URLs as legitimate ones.
    Other Types of Phishing
    1. Voice Phishing (Vishing): Scammers call victims, posing as trusted sources.
    2. Social Media Phishing: Scammers use social media platforms to phish.
    3. QR Code Phishing: Scammers use QR codes to direct victims to malicious sites.
    4. Angela Phishing: Scammers use compromised email accounts to phish.
    5. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Phishing: Scammers intercept communication between two parties.
    Common online scams (scholarships, job offers, e-commerce fraud).
    
    Scholarship Scams:

    1. Fake job postings asking for payment or personal info.
    2. "Work-from-home" scams requiring upfront fees or equipment purchases.
    3. Phony job interviews or recruitment agencies demanding payment.
    
    E-commerce Fraud:
    1. Fake online stores or product listings.
    2. Scammers posing as sellers, asking for payment outside of platform.

    How to identify and avoid phishing attempts.
    1. Urgency: Be cautious of messages that create a sense of urgency.
    2. Spelling and Grammar: Legitimate organizations usually have professional communications.
    3. Suspicious Sender: Verify the sender's email address.
    4. Fake Links: Hover over links to check the URL.
    5. Attachments: Avoid downloading attachments from unknown senders.
    6. Request for Sensitive Info: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive info via email.

Module 3: Identity Theft and Account Security</p>
Objective: To teach students about the risks of identity theft and securing personal accounts.
Content:
What is identity theft?
Identity theft is a serious crime where an individual's personal and sensitive information, such as name, social security number, credit card details, or passport information, is stolen and used without their consent. This stolen information can be used to commit financial fraud, open new accounts, obtain loans or credit cards, or even gain employment. Identity thieves may obtain personal information through various means, including phishing scams, data breaches, stolen wallets or documents, or hacking into secure databases. Victims of identity theft often suffer financial loss, damage to their credit score, and emotional distress. To protect themselves, individuals must be vigilant in safeguarding their personal information, monitoring their financial accounts, and reporting any suspicious activity to the authorities.

    Module 5: Online Grooming and Social Engineering</p>
Objective: To educate students on the dangers of online predators and social engineering tactics.
Content:
What is online grooming?
Online grooming is a sinister and predatory practice where individuals, often adults, manipulate and exploit children or teenagers through online platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and gaming communities. Groomers use tactics such as building trust, sharing explicit content, and emotional manipulation to exploit their victims, often with devastating consequences. This exploitation can lead to severe emotional trauma, sexual abuse, and even physical harm. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and online platforms to be vigilant and proactive in preventing online grooming by educating children about online safety, monitoring their online activities, and reporting suspicious behavior to authorities. By working together, we can protect vulnerable individuals and create a safer online environment.
How predators use social media and online games to target students.
Social Media Tactics:
1. Creating fake profiles to gain trust
2. Sending friend requests to minors
3. Sharing explicit or harmful content
4. Using hashtags to target specific groups
5. Direct messaging or commenting on posts
Online Gaming Tactics:

What is social engineering, and how it manipulates trust to gather sensitive information.
Social engineering is a manipulative tactic used to deceive individuals into divulging confidential information, gaining unauthorized access, or performing certain actions that compromise security. It exploits human psychology, leveraging cognitive biases, trust, and emotional responses to achieve malicious goals. Social engineers use various techniques, such as phishing, pretexting, and baiting, to create a false sense of urgency, authority, or familiarity, making victims more likely to comply with their requests. This can lead to devastating consequences, including financial loss, identity theft, and compromised sensitive data. By understanding social engineering tactics and cultivating a culture of awareness and skepticism, individuals and organizations can better protect themselves against these insidious threats and safeguard their security and privacy.
Manipulation Techniques:
1. Gaslighting: Making victims question reality.
2. Anchoring: Influencing decisions with initial information.
3. Scarcity: Creating false urgency.
4. Social proof: Using fake testimonials or endorsements.

Content:
Importance of digital hygiene (updating software, using secure networks).
Maintaining good digital hygiene is essential in today's interconnected world.
